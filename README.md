# DDEG - Dungeons & Dragons Encounter Generator

WORK IN PROGRESS
An encounter generator for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e.

This encounter generator will allow you to enter a number of characters, their level and select a difficulty. It will then calculate the CR and Experience required and return a list of suggested monsters for the encounter. You can expand these monsters for full details of each one.

Backend API can be found at [DDEG_API](https://github.com/hayleyashby7/DDEG_API)
